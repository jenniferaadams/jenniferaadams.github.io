            <p class ="aboutInfo"> Hi, I'm Jennifer. <br>
                I am a full-stack developer. I am currently enrolled at WeCanCodeIt, a full-time coding bootcamp. In my previous career, I was a full-time photographer and college professor. 
                I became interested in software development after managing my own website as well as web pages for clients. I am passionate about coding and enjoy back and front end development. I want to combine my design skills with my computer skills to create great products. <br>
                <br>
                I spend my free time hanging out with my family, puttering in the garden, and slowly converting my lawn to native plants.</p>
