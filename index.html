          <p class="!py-3">
            I'm a software developer with a strong foundation in art, design,
            and teaching, which I try to bring into every line of code. I care
            deeply about user experience, accessibility, and creating
            thoughtful, intuitive interfaces that make life easier for the
            people using them.
          </p>
          <p class="!py-3">
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me hanging out with my family,
            puttering in the garden, or slowly converting my lawn into a native
            plant haven.

                I'm a software developer at MoreSteam, where I work across the
                stack to build and maintain Vue and Nuxt applications, integrate
                with back-end services in ColdFusion, C#, and SQL, and manage
                content through Sanity. I focus on creating responsive,
                accessible, and engaging user experiences while also shaping
                content strategy with SEO, analytics, and performance
                optimization.
              </p>
              <p>
                I entered the tech field through a full-time coding bootcamp, We
                Can Code IT, where I learned Java, JavaScript, RESTful APIs,
                Spring, HTML/CSS, and Thymeleaf. Since then, I've expanded into
                modern front-end frameworks, back-end integrations, and data
                handling, gaining experience with tools like Matomo, Google
                Analytics, and structured data for SEO.
              </p>
              <p>
                My career began in photography and education. In college I
                earned a BFA from the Columbus College of Art & Design. I then
                taught Digital Photography and Photoshop at Columbus State for
                13 years while also running my own photography business for 11
                years. Through that work I developed expertise in visual
                storytelling, layout, and design, as well as the ability to
                explain complex concepts clearly to diverse audiences. These
                strengths continue to shape how I approach front-end development
                and user experience today.
